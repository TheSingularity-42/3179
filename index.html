          <h2>Why Sharks?</h2>
          <p>
              Australia holds a reputation as one of the most beach going countries in the world, 
              but for many people in Australia fear of sharks holds them back from enjoying the
              many beautiful beaches spread throughout Australia.  As such this dashboard will 
              explore and examine the statistics behind this shared fear as well as any trends 
              that may appear in the data.
              <br> <br>
              The baseline statistics in the figure to the right are quite important, as it can
              be seen there are 4 main species of shark that attack people within Australia, 
              the Bull Shark, Wobbegong, Tiger Shark, and White Shark (also known as Great White).
              Of note here is the Wobbegong, a small shark (150-180cm) which inhabits the South
              and East coasts of Australia, while they do make up a significant number of the
              attacks on humans they have never caused a fatality, in addition nearly 50% of 
              attacks from Wobbegongs are considered ‘provoked’, usually meaning that the shark 
              was trodden on.  The other sharks that dominate these statistics are known for being
              aggressive as a result of their predatory nature but even then the majority of attacks
              do not result in fatalities.

          <h2>Trends</h2>
          <p>When considering the activities that are most commonly attacked swimming,
             and boarding (bogey boarding and surfing) are the most common for shark 
             attacks. This unsurprisingly peaks in summer when these activities are 
             at their peak. This can be compared with the geographical data shown below, 
             where it can be clearly seen that the majority of attacks occur along the 
             East coast of Australia where these attacks are most common. Interestingly 
             a large amount of the aggravated attacks that have occurred are in Queensland, 
             likely as a result of tourism to the Great Barrier Reef and cage diving. 
              <br><br>
              This trend continues further when analysing the number of attacks as 
              they increase over time, namely, there is a significant increase in 
              the number of yearly attacks after ~1980. An increase in tourism post 
              WWII as well as developments in infrastructure and tourism campaigns 
              would have brought both more Australians, and tourists from outside the 
              country to the beaches, drastically increasing the likelihood of shark attacks.
